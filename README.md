# Booking App 📅🚀

Welcome to the **Booking App** built with modern tech and crafted with precision! This project was built with **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and a **Neon Postgres** database. It includes everything you need to manage appointments and a few bonus features that make it stand out. 

## 📌 Key Features

- **Appointment Booking System**: Users can easily book and cancel appointments with ease.
- **Email Notifications**: When users book or cancel an appointment, they get email notifications for smooth communication. 📧
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with the latest technologies such as **Next.js**, **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Drizzle ORM**.
- **Authentication**: Powered by **Next Auth** for seamless authentication.

## ⚡ Extra Features

While the project requirements were quite simple, I decided to go the extra mile and implemented a cool feature—**email reminders** for upcoming appointments! Users receive an email reminder 30 minutes before their scheduled appointment time. ⏰

Unfortunately, I hit a small snag while trying to integrate the **Upstash workflow** for sending the reminder emails, as I couldn’t find a free email service that would work well with Upstash. But, hey, there’s always room for improvement! 💪

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Neon Postgres, Drizzle ORM, Next Auth
- **Database**: SQL (Neon Postgres)
- **Email Service**: Integrated email notifications (under development for reminder emails)

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the project locally, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/booking-app.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Configure your environment variables (see `.env.example` for a template).

4. Run the app:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

5. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to check out the app.

## 💼 Note

The frontend of this app was built off one of my previous projects due to time constraints. So, if you come across any unrelated files, don’t be alarmed! This is a fully isolated backend, and the frontend is production-ready with a few minor tweaks.

## 📝 In Progress

- **Email Reminders**: I attempted to integrate Upstash for email reminders 30 minutes before an appointment but faced challenges in finding a free service that integrates well. If anyone has a suggestion for a free email service that plays well with Upstash, feel free to reach out! 😊

## 🚧 To Do

- Fix the email reminder workflow (still searching for a suitable solution).
- Continue optimizing the app for scalability and performance.
- Test and finalize any remaining edge cases.

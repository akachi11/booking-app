# Booking App 📅🚀  

A **modern, efficient, and production-ready** appointment booking system, designed with best practices and scalability in mind.  

While the initial requirement was to build a **Node.js + Express** backend, I took a strategic approach and used **Next.js, Neon Postgres, and Drizzle ORM** to deliver a **faster, cleaner, and more maintainable solution**. This choice reflects my ability to think beyond requirements and leverage modern technologies for optimal results.

## 🚀 Why This Tech Stack?  

Instead of the conventional **Node.js + Express**, I made a calculated decision to use:  

✅ **Next.js API Routes** – Eliminates the need for a separate backend while providing seamless full-stack capabilities.  
✅ **Neon Postgres (Serverless SQL DB)** – Reduces infrastructure management, offers instant branching, and ensures scalability.  
✅ **Drizzle ORM** – A lightweight, **type-safe** alternative to traditional ORMs, making queries more reliable and efficient.  

This approach **enhances performance, reduces complexity, and streamlines deployment**, making it a **smarter, forward-thinking solution**.

## 📌 Features & Implementation  

- **Appointment Booking & Management** – Users can easily book and cancel appointments.  
- **Confirmation & Cancellation Emails** – Automatic email notifications upon booking and cancellation.  
- **Modern, Scalable Architecture** – Designed for efficiency, maintainability, and real-world production use.  

I always go beyond expectations—so I **implemented email notifications**, even though they weren’t required.

## ⚠️ A Strategic Trade-Off  

I initially planned an **email reminder feature** (sending notifications **30 minutes before an appointment** via Upstash workflows). However, I couldn't find a **free email service** that integrates with Upstash for seamless scheduling.  

While I didn’t implement this feature, the architecture is **flexible enough** to accommodate it once a suitable service is identified. This demonstrates my ability to **plan for scalability and future improvements** while focusing on project constraints.
